In my free time I've been studying data science and machine learning like crazy! I've never found something so fascinating - I feel pulled to learn more and more about it. I have a few contacts who work as data scientists at very large corporations and they advised that while success in data science relies on strong math and stats knowledge that I should also play to my strengths and focus on programming and become skilled at writing machine learning algorithms.

There is an overwhelmingly large amount of information online on machine learning, so much so that I struggled to figure out where to start. Python is an obvious choice as far as the programming language itself; however Scala is a strong up and comer. Scala runs far more efficiently than Python(afterall, Scala stands for "scalable language") and the Apache Foundation releases their data science tools in Scala first, then Python, and last R.

So I've chosen my language... What's next? Well, what am I trying to learn or predict from my data? That's the question I need to answer before I start writing any code.

I made a decision tree flow chart to help determine what kind of algorithm fits what I'm trying to learn or predict from my data. This flowchart is not perfect but sure will help in your ML algorithm selection.

I used these common constraints to help filter through the decision tree:
<ul>
 	<li>Algorithm speed</li>
 	<li>Algorithm accuracy</li>
 	<li>Linearity</li>
 	<li>Memory footprint</li>
 	<li>Number of features</li>
</ul>
* A few other decision are used as needed

I'm planning on updating the flow chart to include time series algorithms and to separate out two-class averaged perceptron, two-classed bayes point machine, and two-class logistic regression algorithms. More to come! Please leave comments with any suggestions or improvements.
  
  I hope this helps on your journey of learning data science and machine learning.
